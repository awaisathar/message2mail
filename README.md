message2mail
============

message2mail is an irssi script which sends a mail when a user sends you a private message. I was introduced to IRC in 1998 and have been online (on dalnet mostly) more or less since then. Modify the line ```$to='enter.your.email.here@mailinator.com';``` by updating your own email address. Thenn place this script in ```~/.irssi/scripts```, run ```screen irssi``` and exit. Whenever someone messages privately, you get an email and then can log back in to chat if needed. (Modified from the [auto_whois script](scripts.irssi.org/scripts/auto_whois.pl).
